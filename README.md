# 「Sum」
__Θuroboros__ is an experimental traybar-based network connection monitor and daemon for Windows.   
Powered with minimalistic interface, it serves as bulletproof net stabilization utilty.

# 「Featuræ」
* Unobtrusive traybar GUI with slick setup window.
* Replaces Windows autonnection feature, which never works right.

# 「Reassembling」
__Θuroboros__ was written entirelly in [Boo v0.9.7.0](https://github.com/boo-lang/boo) with auxiliary build script provided in _Shell_.  
It requires [ILMerge](https://github.com/Microsoft/ILMerge) to be installed and properly referenced in _release.cmd_ for recompilation.
